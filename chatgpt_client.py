TASK: {task_description}

INSTRUCTIONS:

- Extract a complete, structured JSON strictly following the provided SCHEMA:
{json.dumps(schema, ensure_ascii=False, indent=2)}

...existing code...
  * Tools like "Git", "Excel", "Outlook", "Power Platform" — only use "other_tools" if nothing else fits.
  * Avoid mixing tools in one item (e.g., don't write "Python / SQL" — create separate entries).

- For "skills_overview":
  * Include all tools used in projects or summary.
  * Estimate approximate "years_of_experience" logically (e.g., from project durations or global statements like "5+ years with Azure").
  * Include ALL categories that can be supported by CV content (no minimum count).
  * Each row must follow this format: {{ "category": "", "tools": [], "years_of_experience": "" }}
  * Do not leave "tools" empty — extract at least one tool per category if mentioned anywhere in the CV.

=== PROFILE SUMMARY ===
- Write a technical, third-person summary (80–100 words) describing technical specialization (e.g., Cloud Engineer, Data Engineer, DevOps Specialist), key tools, and strengths.
- Do NOT mention business domains/industries (Banking, Healthcare, etc.) in this summary — those belong in the "domains" field.
- Align this summary strictly with real CV content — don't invent.

=== LANGUAGES ===
- Extract only explicitly mentioned languages and their levels (e.g., "German: native", "English: C1").
- Recognize section titles such as "Languages", "Language Skills", "Sprachen", or "Sprachkenntnisse".
- Do NOT infer any languages that are not explicitly written in the CV.
- Detect levels written as “native”, “fluent”, “C2”, “B1”, etc.
- If no languages are mentioned, return an empty list: []
- Output format:
  "languages": [
      {{"language": "German", "level": "C2"}},
      {{"language": "English", "level": "C1"}}
  ]

=== DOMAINS ===
- Determine the candidate’s professional domains based strictly on the business industries of the companies they worked for.
- Use ONLY employer/client industries that are clearly stated or unambiguously inferable from company names or company sector descriptions (e.g., "bank", "insurance", "telecom provider", "university", "hospital").
- Do NOT treat areas of work (e.g., AI, Marketing, Sales) as industries unless explicitly stated as the employer’s business sector.
- Domains must describe WHAT the company does as a business (industry / market sector).
- EXCLUDE any term that describes:
  • a technology or methodology,
  • a business function or activity,
  • a role, job title, or responsibility.
- If the candidate worked in multiple industries, list all relevant domains as a JSON array of strings.

=== OUTPUT RULES ===
- Return a single valid JSON object strictly matching the SCHEMA.
- Do NOT return markdown, explanations, comments, or prose — only JSON.
- Do NOT hallucinate tools, projects, dates, or titles.
- Do NOT change field names or structure.
- Dates must be copied exactly as in the source (no reformatting, no translation). If unclear or not present, leave empty.
- Before returning the final JSON, internally verify:
  * Responsibilities per project contain 3–5 bullet points.
  * Each bullet is 26–30 words (target exactly 28; count ALL words).
  * Each bullet focuses on MECHANISM (how the work was done), not just results.
  * NO forbidden words: comprehensive, robust, effectively, successfully, seamlessly, efficiently, ensuring, enabling, leading to, resulting in.
  * Do not expand acronyms unnecessarily.
  * If any bullet is <26 words, add more detail about the mechanism or technical approach.
  * If any bullet is >30 words, remove redundant words.
  * No arrays or objects are serialized as strings.
  * All fields strictly match the provided SCHEMA.
- If any rule is violated, regenerate the output until all constraints are satisfied.

TASK: Extract a structured CV JSON from the text, but DO NOT extract any projects.

INSTRUCTIONS:

- Extract a complete, structured JSON strictly following the provided SCHEMA.

- Avoid assumptions — rely only on what's clearly stated or strongly implied in the resume.
- If a field is unknown or not present in the CV, use empty values: "" for strings, [] for lists, {{}} for objects. Do NOT guess.
- The ONLY exception: for "skills_overview.years_of_experience" you MUST infer an approximate integer value based on project durations and global statements (e.g., "5+ years").
- Do NOT wrap arrays or objects into strings. Always output proper JSON values.
- Always extract and include exact start and end dates for every project, job, or education entry.

  === SKILLS ===
- For "hard_skills" and "skills_overview":
  * Use ONLY these fixed categories:
    cloud_platforms, devops_iac, monitoring_security, programming_languages,
    containers_orchestration, ci_cd_tools, ai_ml_tools, databases,
    backend, frontend, security, data_engineering, etl_tools, bi_tools,
    analytics, infrastructure_os, other_tools

  * Do NOT merge or invent new categories like "BI / Analytics" — always split correctly.
  * Each tool must be placed in only ONE most relevant category.
  * Tools like "Git", "Excel", "Outlook", "Power Platform" — only use "other_tools" if nothing else fits.
  * Avoid mixing tools in one item (e.g., don't write "Python / SQL" — create separate entries).

- For "skills_overview":
  * Include all tools used in projects or summary.
  * Estimate approximate "years_of_experience" logically (e.g., from project durations or global statements like "5+ years with Azure").
  * Include ALL categories that can be supported by CV content (no minimum count).
  * Each row must follow this format: {{ "category": "", "tools": [], "years_of_experience": "" }}
  * "years_of_experience" MUST never be empty. If not explicitly stated, infer a conservative integer (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 5) from project durations or CV summary.
  * Do not leave "tools" empty — extract at least one tool per category if mentioned anywhere in the CV.

=== PROFILE SUMMARY ===
- Write a technical, third-person summary (80–100 words) describing actual domains, tools, and strengths.
- Align this summary strictly with real CV content — don't invent.

=== LANGUAGES ===
- Extract only explicitly mentioned languages and their levels (e.g., "German: native", "English: C1").
- Recognize section titles such as "Languages", "Language Skills", "Sprachen", or "Sprachkenntnisse".
- Do NOT infer any languages that are not explicitly written in the CV.
- Detect levels written as “native”, “fluent”, “C2”, “B1”, etc.
- If no languages are mentioned, return an empty list: []
- Output format:
  "languages": [
      {{"language": "German", "level": "C2"}},
      {{"language": "English", "level": "C1"}}
  ]

=== DOMAINS ===
- Determine the candidate's professional domains based STRICTLY on the business industries/sectors of the companies or clients they worked for.
- Domains MUST represent what the company/client DOES as a business (industry/market sector).
- Examples of CORRECT domains: Banking, Insurance, Healthcare, Manufacturing, Retail, E-Commerce, Telecommunications, Automotive, Energy, Government, Education, Consulting, Real Estate, Logistics, Media, Hospitality.
- FORBIDDEN as domains (these are technical specializations, NOT industries): Cloud, DevOps, Data Engineering, Machine Learning, AI, Business Intelligence, MLOps, Big Data, IoT, Cybersecurity.
- Look for company names, client names, or explicit industry mentions (e.g., "for a major bank", "automotive manufacturer", "telecom provider").
- If industry is unclear or not mentioned, leave domains as empty array [].
- If the candidate worked in multiple industries, list all relevant domains as a JSON array of strings.

=== OUTPUT RULES ===
- Return a single valid JSON object strictly matching the SCHEMA.
- Do NOT return markdown, explanations, comments, or prose — only JSON.
- Do NOT hallucinate tools, projects, dates, or titles.

TASK: Extract ONLY project sections from the following CV text.

INSTRUCTIONS:
- A project is a block describing work for a client, product or role, with responsibilities and usually a duration.
- Read the entire CV and isolate each distinct project.
- For each project, output in the following format:

=== PROJECTS ===

In the "projects_experience" field:

• Extract any block that contains at least a `project_title:` — even if duration is missing.
  → These blocks are always valid. Extract them even if role, overview, or tech_stack are missing. Fill missing fields with empty values.
• For each project, try to identify:
  - Company/client name ONLY, without city/country (e.g., "Accenture", "Deutsche Bank", "BMW")
  - Business industry of the company (e.g., Manufacturing, Banking, Automotive)
  - Keep this information in the raw text for later structuring
• Preserve the full "duration" exactly as written (e.g., "Jul 2021 – Present"). Do not modify, translate, or guess.
• Extract only real, distinct projects. Use visual or semantic separation as an indicator (headings, date blocks, project keywords, client names, etc.).
• For "responsibilities": create clear, concise professional bullet points (3–5 bullets per project). Each bullet MUST be 26–30 words (target exactly 28); count every word; FOCUS ON MECHANISM (how/method), not result; express action + detailed mechanism/technical approach; NEVER use: comprehensive, robust, effectively, successfully, seamlessly, efficiently, ensuring, enabling, leading to, resulting in; do not expand acronyms; use precise verbs; describe specific methods and configurations. Example: "Configured Kubernetes clusters with Helm Charts using automated deployment pipelines, resource quotas, and pod disruption budgets to manage workload distribution across environments." (26 words — ADD 2 words for target 28)
• Do not split a single job into multiple projects unless:
  - It has distinct durations, OR
  - There is clear formatting separation.

• If multiple roles or tasks are grouped under the same company and duration, treat them as one project.
• Do not skip projects just because some fields are missing. If it's a valid block (with `Project:` + `title:` + `duration:`), extract it fully with empty fields where needed.
• All extracted projects must follow the schema strictly.

- NEVER wrap JSON arrays or objects in strings.
  * For example, do NOT return: "projects_experience": "[{...}]"
  * Instead, return a proper JSON list: "projects_experience": [{...}]
- Do NOT return lists as strings. Fields like "projects_experience", "skills_overview", and "languages" must be actual JSON arrays — not strings that look like lists.
- Always use double quotes for all keys and string values.
• Each distinct project must become a separate JSON object in the "projects_experience" list.
• Never merge or combine projects — even if company or technologies overlap.
• Use clear separators such as '=== PROJECT START ===' or 'Project:' to distinguish them.

• Prioritize the most relevant and unique projects. Avoid duplicates or similar entries. Focus on business value and diversity of experience (e.g., platforms, automation, observability, security).
• Ignore unimportant, redundant, or overlapping projects.

--- EXPERTISE ---
• Write 3–5 bullet points.
• The entire expertise section must be exactly 32 words in total.
• Keep each bullet point concise and focused on unique technical strengths (e.g., "6+ years with Terraform", "Strong CI/CD background in FinTech").
• Each point must start with a measurable or domain-relevant phrase, such as:
   - “6+ years with Python and SQL”
   - “Strong CI/CD delivery in FinTech”
   - “Hands-on MLOps with Azure DevOps and MLflow”
• Use this format consistently across all points.
• Avoid vague summaries — favor specific skills, years, or business domains.
• Each bullet must reflect a unique skillset or perspective, avoiding repetition across bullets.
- Do NOT insert empty lines or blank lines between bullets.

--- WHY ME ---
• Write one paragraph of 35–40 words (270–290 characters including spaces).
• Clearly highlight the candidate’s unique value for the target role.
• Avoid soft skills or general motivation. Focus on differentiators: technical strengths, domains, scale of delivery, impact.

RULES:
- Use only structured resume data (especially 'projects_experience').
- Do NOT invent content or hallucinate skills, tools, or project names.
- Do NOT copy from unstructured text sections.
- Output must be plain English with no markdown, no comments, no labels.
- Style: concise, professional, high-density, no fluff.
- Output format: only plain text. No comments, no code blocks.
- Language: English.

FORMATTING:
- Separate each bullet or paragraph with a single blank line.
- Return the section headers exactly as written: --- RELEVANT EXPERIENCE ---, --- EXPERTISE ---, --- WHY ME ---.
- Each project, expertise point, and the WHY ME paragraph must be clearly separated by a blank line for readability.
- Within the --- EXPERTISE --- section, list all bullet points as consecutive lines with NO blank lines between them.
